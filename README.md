# Python Crawler: European Union Transaction Log (EUTL)

The [European Union Transaction Log (EUTL)](http://ec.europa.eu/environment/ets/transaction.do) documents transactions made in the European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). 

For most data there is the option to directly download content. This option does not exist for historical transaction data.

This very basic Python crawler allows to download transaction data from the public database.
